Some of my study projects. Strictly academic stuff but there are some pretty interesting assignments, mostly in C++ and some basic Java, C#, and Scheme. Please take a look at them, especially those C++ projects. They used to give me headaches :) You can treat them as an overview of my skills and programming style.
